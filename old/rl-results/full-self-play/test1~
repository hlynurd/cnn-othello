virðist overfitta að þeim sem hann spilaði gegn seinast? 

vil prófa að gefa b-líkönum sem hafa farið í gegnum meiri þjálfun
hærri líkur að vera valin gegn a-líkaninu

prófa aftur m vs n með 1e-5, sjá hvort n aðlagist aðeins hægar að m
gömlu niðurstöðurnar gefa til kynna að þetta sé 0.26 - 0.71 fyrir,
0.50 - 0.47 eftir 2e-4, 0.43 - 0.52 eftir 1e-4
